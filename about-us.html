                We are the Noir restaurant. We strive to provide high quality meals at
                a low, affordable price. We pride ourselves on our exceptional meals
                and good customer service. <br/>
                As our founder once said:
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Look at them, they come to this place when they know they are not pure.
                Customers use the forks, but they are mere trespassers. Only I, Mr. Noir,
                know the true power of the Mac &amp; Cheese. I was cut in half, destroyed, but
                through it's Cuisinart, the Mac &amp; Cheese called to me. It brought me here
                and here I was reborn. We cannot blame these creatures, they are being led by
                a false prophet, an impostor who knows not the secrets of the Cuisinart.
                Behold the Customers, come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm. My
                brothers, did I not tell of this day? Did I not prophesize this moment? Now,
                I will stop them. Now I am changed, reborn through the energy of the Mac &amp;
                Cheese. Forever bound to the Cuisinart. Let it be known, if the Customers want
                true salvation, they will lay down their cutlery, and wait for the baptism
                of my Cuisinart. It is time. I will teach these trespassers the redemptive
                power of my Cuisinart. They will learn it's simple truth. The Customers
                are lost, and they will resist. But I, Mr. Noir, will cleanse this
                place of their impurity.
            </p>
